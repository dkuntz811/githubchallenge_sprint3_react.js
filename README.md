It was developed to be used in applications with large amounts of data that change over time (think Facebook). 
React uses components (component-based architecture)
-If a component gets too complex, smaller, simpler components can be created.

......*Using the render() function will create a virtual div or other html element
......*That same render() component can be used later to update the same element with different info. ==fast
